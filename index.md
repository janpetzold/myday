  <sup>Create & email appointments via prompt</sup>
</p>

mydayGPT is a [custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-H30age5WJ-myday) that aims to simplify scheduling of appointments. Just use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and use it to create an appointment in [.ics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format that will be sent via mail to the recipient.

The chatbot will automatically ask you for start/end time, location and subject of the appointment unless you provide it directly. Also the mail address is needed to correctly deliver it. 

To see it in action just go to

https://chat.openai.com/g/g-H30age5WJ-myday

or search for "myday" in the [GPT Store](https://chat.openai.com/gpts) 

## Features

- create appointments using voice/text input of the chatbot
- works in any input language (thanks to ChatGPT)
- will work on any platform that your recipient uses (Android, iPhone, Outlook, Thunderbird, MacOS, Windows, Smart Watch...)
- verifies timezone so it will work for any region you're in
- chat history simplifies re-creating similar appointments with same recipient over time 

There are more features in the pipeline so stay tuned or just raise a request in my [Github repository](https://github.com/janpetzold/myday/issues).

  <sup>Create & email appointments via prompt</sup>
</p>

mydayGPT is a [custom GPT](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-H30age5WJ-myday) that aims to simplify scheduling of appointments. Just use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to create an appointment in [.ics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) format that will be sent via mail attachment to the recipient. [ICS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) is a common standard for events/calendar items and widely supported, however creating & sending this out manually is time-consuming, therefore this GPT was created.

The chatbot will automatically ask you for start/end time, location and subject of the appointment unless you provide it directly in the prompt. Also the mail address is needed to correctly deliver it. 

To see it in action just go to

[https://chat.openai.com/g/g-H30age5WJ-myday](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-H30age5WJ-myday)

or search for "myday" in the [GPT Store](https://chat.openai.com/gpts).

## Features

- works in any input language (thanks to ChatGPT)
- resulting .ics file is delivered via mail attachment and can easily be added to whatever target calendar the recipient uses by one tap/click
- will work on any platform that your recipient uses (Android, iPhone, Outlook, Thunderbird, MacOS, Windows, Smart Watch...)

- chat history simplifies re-creating similar appointments with same recipient over time
